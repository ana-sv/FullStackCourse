# [[ Part 1 ] Introduction to React](https://fullstackopen.com/en/part1/introduction_to_react)


##### Notes

The easiest way to get started by far is by using a tool called Vite.

Let's create an application called part1, navigate to its directory and install the libraries:

```
npm create vite@latest part1 -- --template react
cd part1
npm install
```

The application is started as follows

```
npm run dev
```
